# A Memorial To Matthew Felton

## Matthew Felton
Matthew Felton was a dear friend and colleague who passed away on the 14th of February 2018, aged 29. He was a funny, endearing and loving person who lived for coding, Relentless Energy Drinks, Geeky T-shirts, Pokemon, Nintendo, Nintendo games and copious amounts of red wine. As a software developer he was talented, driven and, most of all, fun to work with. 

He will be forever remembered for making weird screehing noises as he deployed his work and for saying "it worked on my machine" as we deployed his work. Not many people could learn 3 different computer languages and still be able to deliver an enterprise ready solution.

Matt had been suffering from an illness that ultimately took him from us. However, during that time he continued to support his team and learned new skills. This repository is a memorial to his work, drive, his stubbornness and his skill. This repository will remember Matthew Felton, our friend, our **Matty Moo**.
